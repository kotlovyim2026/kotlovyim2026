# Hi, I’m Maksym Kotlovyi 👋

Fullstack developer focused on **React / Next.js (App Router)** and **NestJS / Express / FastAPI**.  
I like building **product-ready systems** with strong engineering basics: **architecture, security, reliability, testing**.

- 🌍 Location: Ukraine / EU-ready
- 🧰 Stack: React, Next.js, TypeScript, NestJS, Express, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker, RabbitMQ
- 🎯 Current focus: becoming a strong **Middle Fullstack Developer**
- 🧪 Engineering interests: **SecOps / SOAR**, event-driven systems, policy engines (RBAC/ABAC), RAG pipelines

## 🚀 Featured Project: SentinelForge

**SentinelForge** is a SecOps platform:
**webhook ingestion → incidents → evidence-based AI explanations (RAG + Mock LLM) → SOAR playbooks → Zero-Trust policies**.

Key parts:
- Event-driven architecture (**RabbitMQ**)
- Playbook executor with **retries + DLQ + idempotency**
- **RBAC + ABAC** policy enforcement + simulation
- AI summaries with **citations** (audit-friendly, deterministic mock)

➡️ Repo: `sentinelforge` (pinned)

## 🛠 What I care about
- Clean architecture and maintainable code
- Security basics (auth, access control, OWASP mindset)
- Reliability patterns (idempotency, retries, DLQ)
- Testing pyramid (unit → integration → e2e)
- Clear docs and demo-ready delivery
